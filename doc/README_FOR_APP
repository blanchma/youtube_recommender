- only searching w/ phrases that for sure appear in videos
- calculating p_rare to favor rare words for search
- calculating tfidf for each word in a video
- New version of ruby with native unicode support


TODO
- using weighted average for video scoring
- coeff of correllation
- percentiles: split ratings/views into 99 chunks, take the top 1%, make them all the same, repeat for each percentile

coeff of correl.:

  go through ratings
    for each video:
      get avg_word_score, rating_score, views_score
        aws: [0.99, 0.44, 0.12]
         rs: [0.88, 0.98, 0.54]
         vs: [0.23, 0.45, 0.98]
           
    ratings: [1, 0, -1]
            


To calculate the coeff-corr of p_rare for each word in a video:
  - compare the p_like of each video
